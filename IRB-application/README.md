# IRB application

This folder contains all files related to the IRB application that we filed before carrying out our study. In our application, we wrote down all ethical considerations, drafted an information letter and informed consent form, and spelled out how this study is in agreement with the GDPR. The study has been approved by the research ethics and data management committee associated with the first author. 

**Table of contents**

This folder contains the following files:

- `Information-letter.md`: Information letter providing details about the study, so that participants are able to give their informed consent. Names and other identifying information have been redacted for anonymous peer review.
- `Informed-consent.md`: Informed consent form asking participants to agree to take part in our study. This form is placed on a separate page of our questionnaire (after the information letter), so that it is clearly communicated what their consent entails.
- `Questionnaire.pdf`: Original questionnaire submitted to the IRB.

**Updates**

During the review process, we altered some questions to minimize personal information. Specifically: 

* Experience in years is not asked in terms of the exact number of years, but in terms of different ranges.
* The information letter was made more explicit to note that the results may be used in one or more future publications on this topic.
