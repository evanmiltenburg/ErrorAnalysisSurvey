# About this study

## What is this study about?

This research project aims to understand the status of error analysis in NLG. We aim to answer three questions: 

- What do researchers think about error analysis? 
- In what circumstances are researchers willing and able to carry out an error analysis? 
- What are the barriers to carrying out an error analysis?

This study builds on an earlier position paper about error analysis, which shows that relatively few NLG papers provide an error analysis, and which provide a how-to guide for carrying out error analyses. You can read the paper [here](https://aclanthology.org/2021.inlg-1.14/).

## What does participating in the study entail?

For this study, we ask you to answer a short series of questions. We expect this to take about 10 minutes. Most of these questions are multiple-choice, but there are also some open questions. Your answers will be completely anonymous, and it is impossible for us to trace back the answers to you.

## Disadvantages, consequences & risks

- You will be asked to answer a series of questions, which takes time. We tried to make the questionnaire as short as possible, so as to minimise any possible inconvenience.
- Although we tried to prevent any question from offending any participants, it may still be the case that you take offence with some of the questions. In this case, feel free to leave a comment at the end of the survey, or to contact either us or the ethics committee directly. Contact details are at the bottom of this page.
- Some questions might be controversial. We record minimal personal information, so that you are free to speak your mind, without any consequences. (The only personal information we collect is whether you are in industry or in academia, and how experienced you are.)
- We do not foresee any other risks connected to your taking part in this study. 

## Advantages

There are no direct advantages to taking part in this study. The indirect advantage is that your contribution will help us understand how NLG researchers feel about error analysis, and we aim to publish a full report through one of the many open access venues in our field (e.g. INLG).

## Rights

Under the main applicant's Universityâ€™s code of ethics, you are entitled to a number of rights:

- Your participation is completely voluntary, and you have the right to decline to participate and withdraw from the research once participation has begun, without any negative consequences, and without providing any explanation.
- You have the right, in principle, to request access to and rectification, erasure, restriction of or object to the processing of the personal data. For more information, please see: URL. Do note that, because all data is fully anonymised, it may be impossible for us to delete or alter your responses.
- Your participation is fully confidential, meaning that your answers will be fully anonymised. We have configured Qualtrics such that it will also not collect your IP address.
- Your consent to participate only lasts for the duration of the study, and may be withdrawn at any time.

## What does consent mean?

By consenting, you indicate that you are voluntarily taking part in this study, and that you allow for your data to be processed. This means that:

- You agree that your answers may be used to publish a research article on this topic.
- The data will be stored on the computers of the research team, with both local (hard drive) and online (protected cloud drive) backups.
- The data will be made public upon completion of this study.
- You acknowledge that there is no financial compensation for taking part in this study.

The actual consent form is on the next page.
