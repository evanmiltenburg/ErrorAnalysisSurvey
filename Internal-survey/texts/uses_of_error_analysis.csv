1,"Error analyses better explain the capabilities of the systems, which is not always the case with automatic metrics for evaluation as well as human ratings. "
2,"It provided me with a better understanding of the type and frequency of errors.  This is much more useful to me in terms of understanding the problem, than a single number metric within a task."
3,"The error analyses provided additional insight into the performance of the NLG systems. Usually, the error analyses would include more details on the accuracy or fidelity of the text generation system. "
4,much better understanding of the kind of errors the systems make
5,It gives much better insight into the system behavior than overall statistics from the automatic metrics or human evaluation.
6,Acknowledging patterns of model shortcomings was very helpful in making the differences (strengths and weaknesses) between different models more concrete than simply discussing small differences in automatic metrics.
7,Allows for a more detailed understanding of a system's failure modes
8,"The analyses gave insights into the distribution of errors, and helped me to think of ways in which the system could be improved. Furthermore, it helped me see the ways in which flawed outputs could cause harm to users or other stakeholders."
9,They help to quantify the errors within that particular study but are not particularly helpful when comparing the results with other works.
