1,"If it is a standard approach in our field, then people will do it. "
2,"The main factors are reviewers not considering them a contribution, and paper page limit.  All the resources in the world will make no difference whilst this is the case.  As an author of our error analysis I tried to include one in a journal submission (10 page ACL format) but had to cut it for space.  We include 2 pages of math that is basically the same as every other 2 pages of math, so we can pretend we are generalizing, but no error analysis."
3,"I would be more likely to carry out an error analysis if I see it as part of the requirements to journals / conferences, and if I see more accepted papers including error analysis."
4,I'd say the main thing missing is push/incentives to move the field to do them on a larger scale.
5,"Providing an effective training for the NLG community,  by conducting workshops, tutorials, and demos."
6,"If error analyses are incentivized/prioritized from a publishing/reviewer perspective, this would help justify the time/resources required to complete error analyses."
7,Changing text domains: some types of errors are impracticably time consuming to identify in the domains I work with due to the amount of input data consumed by the system.
8,As mentioned before. More encouragement from conference/workshop organisers for error analyses to be conducted.
9,"If other researchers cared more about error analysis. If others don't understand the importance of error analysis, the practice of carrying one out will be limited, and readers probably won't care to read about it in papers that have been written."
