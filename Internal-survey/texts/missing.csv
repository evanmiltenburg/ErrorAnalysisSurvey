1,An error taxonomy! 
2,"Much like evaluation, there are guidelines, but researchers (particularly at the PGR or small group level) are often left to try and just find something that works for them.  This is in part also because there is no one way to do an error analysis, and the problem/domain can have an effect on what you should do as well."
3,Standardised error definitions and guidelines for conducting error analysis with them.
4,"I'd say ""almost"" -- since not much is needed. Some easy-to-use annotation tools would be helpful, but not crucial -- simple ad-hoc scripts and spreadsheets work well enough for me in most cases"
5,a taxonomy agreed upon by the community which would make the results comparable across papers
6,"Either templates and a thorough how-to guide, or a repository of existing error analyses to use as examples."
7,Available domain experts in the minority languages I deal with
8,A taxonomy of common errors.
9,Standardisation and the expectation from other researchers.
