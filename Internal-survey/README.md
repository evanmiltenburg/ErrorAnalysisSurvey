# Internal survey

This folder contains all files (code, data, summary of the results) related to the internal survey we carried out before spreading the survey among NLG researchers and practitioners. The idea here is that this makes us aware of our own perspectives and biases, and the results enable us to contrast our perspective with that of our respondents.

**Table of contents**

* `README.md`: This file.
* `internal_survey_results.xlsx`: The results from our internal survey, taken by the authors and a number of colleagues to try out the survey. This also gives us a good estimate of the survey duration.
* `Analysis.ipynb`: The code to analyse the results from our internal survey.
* `quantitative_analysis.pdf`: The Analysis notebook exported as a PDF file for easier reading on other devices.
* `Evaluation of internal survey.pdf`: Qualitative analysis of the responses to the open questions, carried out by the first author. Next to a summary of the results, this file also contains two responses written by co-authors of this paper. Taken together, this file and the quantitative analysis represent our general stance towards error analysis, before carrying out the survey.
* `Q16.pdf`: A visualisation of the answers to Question 16.
* `Q18.pdf`: A visualisation of the answers to Question 18.
* `texts`: All the text responses for the open questions. Each file in this folder contains the answers to the question mentioned in the file name.
