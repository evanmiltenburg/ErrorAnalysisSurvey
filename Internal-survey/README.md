# Internal survey

This folder contains all files (code, data, summary of the results) related to the internal survey we carried out before spreading the survey among NLG researchers and practitioners. The idea here is that this makes us aware of our own perspectives and biases, and the results enable us to contrast our perspective with that of our respondents.
