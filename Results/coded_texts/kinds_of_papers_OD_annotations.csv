I hadn't heard of error analysis before this survey, but have read a lot of NLG papers, none of which contained an error analysis.  Not doing so, seems at best a little dishonest.","Original comment"

"R_1msf0KMkf86xvU7","Pretty much all papers that claim to be doing something better than others. For NLG, in particular, just showing that a model gets higher X score(s) does not help understand why that is the case. It serves better to the community to have an understanding of the real capabilities and limitations of the models. So, to better compare systems, an error analysis can help show where a particular system is ""doing better"" than the other, making a stronger case for using it (or not). ","Original comment"

"R_u3vQ66FYA58WEnL","I have to say that what is considered an error depends partially on the intended use of the NLG system. For systems that are intended to produce grammatical coherent text for human audiences, error analysis is necessary in order to get a good estimation of system quality. However, some systems might be intended to produce different output, for example poetry, or literary-style imitations, so criteria of errors may be different there. There might also be papers that focus on computational efficiency, and thus disregard quality of output, so those might avoid error analysis.  

Some NLG papers use BLEU scores as indicators of NLG quality. This is very convenient as BLEU scores can be computed automatically against available human-sourced 'gold data'. But BLEU scores can be misleading and are not a good alternative to manual analysis of errors.  ","Original comment"
