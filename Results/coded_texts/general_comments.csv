R_2viGZF9YUjaTxAZ,"No.  Thank you for introducing me to the concept of error analysis.  In at least some small way, I will probably take this concept and use it in our work."
R_3CClKJCQVTV5fKQ,"I didn't know much on error analysis before answering the questionnaire, hence, I couldn't rate the amountzof existing error analysis tools. I would have liked to have a ""I don't know"" field for the Likert scale questions. "
R_8AMlQcW7cB0S0lH,This is an important study
R_1msf0KMkf86xvU7,Thanks for carrying out this survey. Looking forward to the results and the recommendations.

R_10rcJTKXKKERNbF,"Error analysis should focus on language features, text genre characteristics and  adequacy to the task, not a mere statistical analysis."
R_u3vQ66FYA58WEnL,"Thank you, it was a quite good survey. "
R_2c0i363Fh3IQN3w,I think the study of NLG errors should also take into account the structure of the sentence and it is important the study is human based.
