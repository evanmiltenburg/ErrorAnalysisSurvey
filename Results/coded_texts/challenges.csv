R_u3vQ66FYA58WEnL,"Manual error analysis is very time-consuming. In my case, we also used 2 annotators, for measuring inter-annotator agreement. I had to prepare the rubrics, then prepare sample materials for training annotators, then conduct training trials. Only then we could begin the real annotation and analysis.    So, again, it is a process that takes time and resources.  ",Original comment

- It can be challenging to define properly the error categories, which is crucial to make the analysis both informative (categories should be fine-grained enough) and reliable (categories should be result in a high IAA).",Original comment
