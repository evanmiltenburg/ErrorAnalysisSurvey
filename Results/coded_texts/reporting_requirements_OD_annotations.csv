"R_2viGZF9YUjaTxAZ","I think including the types of errors made is fine, however, I think that a list of the errors would be incredibly useful, as this would allow people reading papers to see commonality amongst NLG systems (for example, do GPT-J, GPT-3 and GPT-NeoX all make the same mistakes?)","Original comment"

Not only raw numbers, maybe percentages would be better. Also naming which categories were ignored and due to which reasons. ","Original comment"

Have you considered the necessary cardinality of your sample to have a trustable agreement coefficient? The characteristics of your raters are also important, if you do this, though, the composition of your annotator group and the quantity of your sample shall vary.
