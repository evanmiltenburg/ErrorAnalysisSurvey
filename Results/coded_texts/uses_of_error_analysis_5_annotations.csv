R_3CClKJCQVTV5fKQ,"Clear view on data and not only a cherry picking error description. The different categories are helpful to identify problems of the NLG system. NLG is often evaluated only by automatic metrics which are not perfect and do not take all issues into account, such a error analysis can help to identify errors and not only trying to reach the best scores. The NLG systems get more and more black boxes which we don't know what they are doing so a manual analysis is helpful for identifying problems which we had overlooked focusing on automatic metrics.

R_12RQqpVGE2qYoq3,"I quite agree with Emiel's conclusions in his paper: ""Underreporting of errors in NLG output"". Most error analyses I have seen are in psycholinguistics (my background), and they allowed 'us' to develop an architecture or pipeline, figuring out to some extent the time course of language production. Actually, if I were allowed to take 3 books with me on an island, then I'd choose Levelt's 'bible' Speaking, and one of the various books devoted to errors, as they contain in hidden form how things work, and why they don't. Errors are incredibly valuable clues, regardless the specific aspect of the process (choice of meaning, word access, synctatic processing, ...) or the task (reading, writing, speaking, misunderstanding/mishearing/misreading).",Original comment,Original comment
