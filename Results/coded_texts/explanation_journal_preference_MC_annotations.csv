R_3EVTcFVWkcADmAn,It's make my NLG system more accurate.
R_1Fb4cMbBLCr1Mps,Based on assumption that the conference is NOT ACL or similiar top-tier venue!
R_1zRNqaef0umL2QF,"More space, less deadline pressure"
R_2Bx0flTszYdxDPA,The difference would be the depth of the analysis but heading something remains Important in both cases
R_tK6Arub4LFxhMTT,The quality of my work should not differ by the venue
R_1OxiIuva6OIySjr,"it should be a norm, similar to reporducibility, at both venues."
R_9FWWZPFa03RKtDb,more space and higher expectations
R_2viGZF9YUjaTxAZ,"position of writing a paper or presenting at a conference, I would almost certainly include an error analysis."
R_3CClKJCQVTV5fKQ,"Higher page limit, more time to publish, more quality, higher demands in journal articles "
R_3PUctIwcmDJt5t4,Journal article usually offer a higher page limit.
R_8AMlQcW7cB0S0lH,"for long papers essential, any ACL endorsed conference
Also I think there is an overeliance on metric based evaluations without any clear understanding of there strengths and weakness(BLEU)  and a general decline to provide any linguistic analysis of outputs. the focus on deep learning approaches, decline of computational linguistic skills in postgraduate researchers (with solely an ML training, nor research evaluation encouraged.  In some cases they don't have the linguistic skills."
R_1DAuvy72fx3Y9px,"More space and time, journal publication, more likely to have an error analysis."
R_3PmNb56WDtzFl00,Error analyses should be included in both conf and journal papers
R_1msf0KMkf86xvU7,"more space in a journal article allows to expand on the experiments, including the error analysis. our research are is heavily conference-focused, our main points of reference are conference papers. So, since they are regarded in a higher standard, they should also be subjected to a higher level of scrutiny and quality expectation,  an error analysis included in both."
R_1oGS3sNlc9Pzbhu,"deadlines and page limits for conference papers, typically tighter, less likely to do this a conference paper"
R_cIRoJzsDgiLpSWB,Error analysis will contribute to may article 
R_2at4iBHFbZ9qXF9,"Journal articles, more comprehensive,  include an error analysis to give a more complete picture of an NLG system."
R_3dS2PTlM6FW2INE,"Bigger page limit, not strict deadline "
R_2wmLQttiaGr9OkJ,"depend on the size and the study, e.g. system for  legal/medical purposes or creativity"
R_u3vQ66FYA58WEnL,"journal reviewers, more demanding on details, including error analysis. journals,more space (pages)"
R_2c0i363Fh3IQN3w,in our field conference paper are as important as journal papers
R_3rMofNwuc818Ldq,"more space in a journal paper, but on needs to find space in a shorter paper too. "
R_12RQqpVGE2qYoq3,Difference of space and time.
