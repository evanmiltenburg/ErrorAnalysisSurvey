R_2uIYMUOPADUs0Gp,General attention to the topic,Original comment
R_1Fb4cMbBLCr1Mps,general taxonomy gives idea of challenging aspects,Original comment
R_1zRNqaef0umL2QF,Qualitative analysis plus examples more informative than numeric scores for understanding where improvements are still needed,Original comment
R_2Bx0flTszYdxDPA,They help ground the limitations of the systems And create directions for future work,Original comment
R_tK6Arub4LFxhMTT,Allows to assess whether things you belive could be improved are indeed the things that should be,Original comment
R_1OxiIuva6OIySjr,They help understand the limitation of the proposed method. ,Original comment
R_9FWWZPFa03RKtDb,It gives a complementary picture of standard metrics.,Original comment
R_3CClKJCQVTV5fKQ,"Clear view on data and not only a cherry picking error description. The different categories are helpful to identify problems of the NLG system. NLG is often evaluated only by automatic metrics which are not perfect and do not take all issues into account, such a error analysis can help to identify errors and not only trying to reach the best scores. The NLG systems get more and more black boxes which we don't know what they are doing so a manual analysis is helpful for identifying problems which we had overlooked focusing on automatic metrics.

R_3PUctIwcmDJt5t4,"Diversification of the errors, making the researcher able to fine-tune a system based on them.",Original comment
R_8AMlQcW7cB0S0lH,"It provided useful insights into the type of errors produced in the output which are not evident in string based or corpus based metrics - BLEU, BLEURT etc",Original comment
R_1DAuvy72fx3Y9px,"It shows the kinds of failures the system has, and points to where problems in the (often Black Box) System may lie. 

It is also a good sign that the whole analysis of results has considered all results. ",Original comment
R_3PmNb56WDtzFl00,"Qualitative insights about what doesnt work.    Which is useful for planning future research, and also for deciding whether to use a model/algorithm in a project (since some types of errors are much more concerning than others)",Original comment
R_1msf0KMkf86xvU7,They provide an idea of where the models are actually failing. This helps understand if the proposed approach is tackling the problem it intends to solve (or improve on). It also gives ideas for future work.,Original comment
R_1oGS3sNlc9Pzbhu,"Error analyses can show the areas where a system struggles to generate the correct output which can be accuracy, coherence, fluency, etc.",Original comment
R_cIRoJzsDgiLpSWB,The way that error is treated in language due to the difficulty of  the natural language processing methods and its variety across the different levels of processes,Original comment
R_1Owpizm5kuD60On,Awareness of the kinds of biases these system exhibit when trying to generate something meaningful and at the same point also showcasing what needs to be done to further the improvement of these models ,Original comment
R_3dS2PTlM6FW2INE,"Providing extra depth about the state of their system. That is, providing more detailed information about the strenghts and challenges regarding the system that you would not be able to obtain if you would just report average fluency, BLEU, etc. Furthermore, it is also more ""objective"" than the average qualitative analysis that we often see, that generally just reports overall first impressions of the author.",Original comment
R_u3vQ66FYA58WEnL,"When NLG error analysis is conducted manually (i.e. by humans), it provides valuable information about the quality of NLG, and also can tell us where the problems are.",Original comment
R_2c0i363Fh3IQN3w,It specifies error providing categories for them.,Original comment
R_3rMofNwuc818Ldq,"It clearly shows what are the system's flaws and strong sides, and gives explicit hints with respect to how the system can be improved.",Original comment
R_0fDpb4gKFzYr9PH,understanding the weaknesses of the system,Original comment
R_12RQqpVGE2qYoq3,"I quite agree with Emiel's conclusions in his paper: ""Underreporting of errors in NLG output"". Most error analyses I have seen are in psycholinguistics (my background), and they allowed 'us' to develop an architecture or pipeline, figuring out to some extent the time course of language production. Actually, if I were allowed to take 3 books with me on an island, then I'd choose Levelt's 'bible' Speaking, and one of the various books devoted to errors, as they contain in hidden form how things work, and why they don't. Errors are incredibly valuable clues, regardless the specific aspect of the process (choice of meaning, word access, synctatic processing, ...) or the task (reading, writing, speaking, misunderstanding/mishearing/misreading).",Original comment
