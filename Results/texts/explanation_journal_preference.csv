comment-000,It's make my NLG system more accurate.
comment-001,Based on assumption that the conference is NOT ACL or similiar top-tier venue!
comment-002,"More space, less deadline pressure"
comment-003,The difference would be the depth of the analysis but heading something remains Important in both cases
comment-004,The quality of my work should not differ by the venue
comment-005,"I think it should be a norm, similar to reporducibility, at both venues."
comment-006,There are more space and higher expectations.
comment-007,"Having discovered that error analysis is a thing, if I were in the position of writing a paper or presenting at a conference, I would almost certainly include an error analysis."
comment-008,"Higher page limit, more time to publish, more quality and higher demands in journal articles "
comment-009,Journal article usually offer a higher page limit.
comment-010,"I think for long papers it is essential and I would expect this any ACL endorsed conference.
Also I think there is an overeliance on metric based evaluations without any clear understanding of there strengths and weakness(BLEU)  and a general decline to provide any linguistic analysis of outputs. I fear the focus on deep learning approaches has resulted in a decline of computational linguistic skills in postgraduate researchers (with solely an ML training) and nor  are such research evaluation encouraged.  In some cases they don't have the linguistic skills."
comment-011,"More space and time involved in a journal publication, means it is more likely to have an error analysis."
comment-012,Error analyses should be included in both conf and journal papers
comment-013,"Normally, having more space in a journal article allows to expand on the experiments, including the error analysis. However, since our research are is heavily conference-focused, our main points of reference are conference papers. So, since they are regarded in a higher standard, they should also be subjected to a higher level of scrutiny and quality expectation. So, I do think an error analysis should be included in both."
comment-014,"The deadlines and page limits for conference papers are typically tighter, so I would be slightly less likely to do this a conference paper. "
comment-015,Error analysis will contribute to may article definitely because it can increase the what my investigation has done.
comment-016,"Journal articles are more comprehensive, and they should include an error analysis to give a more complete picture of an NLG system."
comment-017,"Bigger page limit, you are not as much faced with a strict deadline that requires you to think about how to do the most in the least amount of time."
comment-018,depend on size and the study. If the system is for legal/medical purpose or for creativity
comment-019,"journal reviewers tend to be more demanding on details, including error analysis. Also, journals provide more space (pages) for articles."
comment-020,I understand in our field conference paper are as important as journal papers.
