R_2uIYMUOPADUs0Gp,Not on a formal and structured level as for now.
R_3EVTcFVWkcADmAn,It can improve the results and quality of generations.
R_1Fb4cMbBLCr1Mps,Need to measure accuracy of generated texts
R_2Bx0flTszYdxDPA,They are too useful to not do them
R_tK6Arub4LFxhMTT,Sometimes it is needed...
R_1OxiIuva6OIySjr,I think it's useful
R_9FWWZPFa03RKtDb,It is useful
R_8AMlQcW7cB0S0lH,I think its important to manually inspect the data from a computational linguistic perspective and it can provide valuable insights into improving inputs perhaps or neural architectures in order to guarantee more semantically adequate   production systems.
R_3PmNb56WDtzFl00,Essential part of evaluation!
R_1msf0KMkf86xvU7,"I do believe in the importance of error analysis, so I'll make sure to include them as much as possible. However, when working with collaborators, not everyone sees its importance and is willing to invest time (and resources) on it."
R_1oGS3sNlc9Pzbhu,"Scores from automatic evaluation metrics cannot reliably detect or quantify all types of errors in NLG, so manual error analysis is still probably the best kind of evaluation."
R_3kgFfd7vL38wXiE,Why not :)
R_3dS2PTlM6FW2INE,I feel like the experience with the error analysis I have carried out helps me to outline better categories in the future.
R_2wmLQttiaGr9OkJ,?
R_10rcJTKXKKERNbF,I think carring out error analyses is a way to improve the systems
R_u3vQ66FYA58WEnL,"Error analysis is crucial for many uses of NLG systems, especially for systems intended to produce outputs for human audience."
R_12tjBK7tLWimKGc,"Not necessarily for published research, but doing so for my team is a fairly regular part of my industry job"
