R_3EVTcFVWkcADmAn,No
R_1Fb4cMbBLCr1Mps,no
R_1zRNqaef0umL2QF,Trade-off between improving model/approach vs conducting error analysis
R_2Bx0flTszYdxDPA,Time is the largest barrier
R_1OxiIuva6OIySjr,"Yes. It is not popular to conduct error analysis these days, unfortunately. "
R_2viGZF9YUjaTxAZ,Not really.  I've just never considered running one.
R_3CClKJCQVTV5fKQ,My supervisor do not see the relevance of it as we know no paper with such a error analysis and hence they recommend me to not spend much time on it. 
R_8AMlQcW7cB0S0lH,No
R_1oGS3sNlc9Pzbhu,"Reproducibility of error analysis or human evaluation in general would be another concern, but there has been some interesting work recently in this area."
R_1Owpizm5kuD60On,The importance given to error analyses is very low in the current research paradigm and we optimize for scores from reviewers for novelty not for wrror analysis
R_3dS2PTlM6FW2INE,"Mostly time and resources, if there is a strict deadline, it is oftentimes quicker to just do a very straightforward quantitative analysis."
R_2wmLQttiaGr9OkJ,lack of tools and resources for all languages
R_10rcJTKXKKERNbF,I think error analysis should be carried out if possible by experts on the area and not by crowdworkers.
R_u3vQ66FYA58WEnL,"Time, money, availability of adequate annotators. A taxonomy of errors could be useful, but it cannot cover everything - there is a variety of issues that can be considered errors, including things that are errors only in some situation but not in other.. Also, a too-big of a taxonomy could be inconvenient to use."
