R_3EVTcFVWkcADmAn,No
R_1Fb4cMbBLCr1Mps,"perhaps, but I cannot think of one at the moment"
R_1zRNqaef0umL2QF,More explicit recognition of value of error analysis in review forms
R_1OxiIuva6OIySjr,"Having it as a requirement. Or ideally making it more common, as a practice that is considered valuable, and then researchers would be inclined to do it not bc of a requirement.  "
R_9FWWZPFa03RKtDb,"More money for research, and easier to higher short-term staff."
R_2viGZF9YUjaTxAZ,"No, on balance I think it's something that should be done when presenting a paper or a conference talk."
R_3CClKJCQVTV5fKQ,More acceptance of error analysis in the NLP community. 
R_8AMlQcW7cB0S0lH,Time and resources (to support the activity )
R_1DAuvy72fx3Y9px,"This is mostly a problem with research culture, when this (error analyses) becomes normal resources will be produced to fulfil the need for resources."
R_1msf0KMkf86xvU7,More money
R_1Owpizm5kuD60On,A thorough task specific taxonomy which easily helps immediately attribute errors found in a certain bucket and also helpful since anything not belonging to the buckets is important and worthy to look at 
R_2at4iBHFbZ9qXF9,"money dedicated for persons doing the analyses, and also money for instructing them clearly in order to get comparable results"

R_2c0i363Fh3IQN3w,"Certainly, if my paper, concentrating on a very small, yet precise fragment, would have the same probability of acceptance of a paper that uses ML on a broad, yet very unprecise linguistic boundaries."
