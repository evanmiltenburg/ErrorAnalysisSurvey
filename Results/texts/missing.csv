comment-002,Better documented taxonomies and procedures

comment-004,Knowledge on the topic. I don't which resources exist yet. 
comment-005,"Don't know which tool is missing, but the practice itself seems relatively novel, so I can expect new resources coming in the future."
comment-006,"Error analysis taxonomy, best practices, guidance, annotation tools."
comment-007,An efficient guideline and platform for setting the standard and replicable error analysis.
comment-008,"taxonomies, examples how to use them, tools"
comment-009,A good taxonomy of error categories you could typically use.
