Scripts and data for our survey on error analysis

This repository contains all files relating to our survey on error analysis. If you find this useful, please consider citing our paper: *Barriers and enabling factors for the use of error analysis in NLG research*.

**Table of contents**

* `Internal-survey`: This folder contains all files (code, data, summary of the results) related to the internal survey we carried out before spreading the survey among NLG researchers and practitioners. The idea here is that this makes us aware of our own perspectives and biases, and the results enable us to contrast our perspective with that of our respondents.
* `IRB-application`: This folder contains all files related to the IRB application that we filed before carrying out our study. In our application, we wrote down all ethical considerations, drafted an information letter and informed consent form, and spelled out how this study is in agreement with the GDPR. The study has been approved by the research ethics and data management committee associated with the first author. 
* `Results`: This folder contains all files (code, data, summary of the results) related to the survey that was distributed among NLG researchers and practitioners.
